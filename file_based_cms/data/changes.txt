When Ruby evaluates a constant reference expression, it returns the value of the constant, or it raises a NameError exception if no constant by that name could be found. Note that constants do not exist until a value is actually assigned to them. This is unlike variables that can come into existence when the interpreter sees, but does not execute, an assignment.
